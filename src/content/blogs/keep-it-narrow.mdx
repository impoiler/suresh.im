## What

Hello fellow devs or whoever is reading this blog, i hope you are doing well .

Today i'll share the personla thoghts on keeping things narrow and simple. in today's world if we look arrount then we can see everyhting is full of distractions. We have to keep our focus on the things that matter to us.

by this topic i'm not reffering any one specific thing but just in-general, like keep your circle qulity and narrow so you can give your best to the people who are in your circle, keep your goals narrow that you can achive them instead of wasting time/energy and making your self fool by setting up the goals that are not achivable.

## Personal Experience

In the pursuit of simplicity, I've encountered my share of challenges. In moments of complexity, where simplicity could have prevailed, I found myself overthinking and complicating matters unnecessarily. A vivid example arises when faced with life's challenges, be they work-related or personal. 

In the past, my mind habitually veered towards anticipating worst-case scenarios and dwelling on the perceived judgment of others. However, as reality unfolds, the truth emerges—few spare the time to ponder our missteps, each engrossed in their own endeavors.

## Your circle matters

As the adage goes, "you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with." This adage holds profound significance; our circle shapes our perspectives and ambitions. Choosing a circle that is both narrow and of high quality is paramount. While my social circle may not be extensive, each connection holds value—they excel in their fields and positively influence my journey. Quality triumphs over quantity.

Having a select few in your circle yields benefits for both parties involved. It allows for meaningful investment of time and resources, fostering personal growth and leaving room for impactful contributions to others' lives.

In the journey of life, there comes a point when shedding childhood pursuits becomes imperative. Focusing on endeavors that align with our values and aspirations becomes a non-negotiable step towards personal evolution.

## The Digital Age Challenge

As i've taked about the advacement in technologies in [I feel like I'm living in the Golden Era](/blog/living-in-golden-era) we uncovered a double-edged sword. The digital age, while offering unprecedented convenience, inundates us with distractions—social media, streaming platforms, and the perpetual allure of instant gratification. While outright avoidance may be challenging, moderation is within our control. A mindful approach to technology usage ensures that the time spent aligns with our objectives, steering clear of aimless scrolling.

It's vital to debunk the myth of gaining value through endless digital scrolls, recognizing the self-deception in seeking satisfaction where none truly exists. The perilous allure of instant dopamine hits, especially for individuals in their 20s and younger, underscores the importance of utilizing this phase for optimal mental and physical productivity.
