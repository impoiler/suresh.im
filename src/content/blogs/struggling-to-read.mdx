Over the past few months, I've noticed a significant decline in my ability to read. I still want to read more, but I can't seem to follow through. Somewhere along the way, I've lost the habit and maybe even the patience for it.

## My Reading Background

I've never really considered myself a “good reader.” Even in high school, I mostly relied on learning in class rather than spending extra time with books. In the digital world, I've always preferred YouTube videos over long articles.

That said, when I started my career (around early 2022), I did read a fair number of technical articles and documentation. It wasn't consistent, but I had at least built some rhythm around reading.

## Why This Happened?

I think the main reason is *me*. When it comes to reading, the brain naturally looks for shortcuts, and I've often taken the easier route. On top of that, AI has completely changed the way I approach reading and information intake.

It's not that AI is bad; it isn't. In fact, if I want a very specific answer, AI often gives me exactly what I need in seconds. That's a much better experience than reading entire promoted articles in Google Search. I actually love Google's AI Overview feature for that reason; it gets to the point.

But this convenience has also ruined my habits. My brain no longer feels the need to read long-form content. It's possible that AI has permanently taken away my reading ability.

## Where I Am Now

At this point, it's extremely difficult for me to sit down and read for even half an hour. I'm aware of the consequences, but honestly, I don't think I'll change much.

The truth is, whether I read or not, AI development is going to keep accelerating. Companies will release new models every few months, and the world will adapt. My own work is tightly connected with AI, so I can't really ignore this revolution even if it means I'm reading less.

I'll see where the future takes me. For now, this is just a quick acknowledgment to myself: reading is slipping away, and I don't know if I'll get it back.
