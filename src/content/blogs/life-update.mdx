### Who am i?

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Suresh, a 20-year-old Software Engineer from India.

Hope you're all doing well.

Big thanks for dropping by and checking out my little spot on the internet. If you're here, it means you're curious about me, and I'm genuinely happy to have you here.

So, I've decided to start this blog thing. I want to share what I'm learning and give you quick updates on what's happening in the tech world. Hopefully, I'll be posting regularly, and who knows, you might find something useful or interesting.

I've been working as a software engineer for about 2 years now, and I reckon I've picked up a few things along the way. Excited to share my thoughts with you all!

### My Journey

So, I wrapped up my Higher Secondary in 2021, focusing on Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Turns out, I wasn't feeling the whole medical scene, and yeah, choosing PCB might have been a bit of a detour, but hey, at least I figured it out early.

Now, since forever, I've been this kid fascinated by computers and gadgets. I'd build stuff out of broken electronic parts, always wondering how things worked. It might not seem super relevant to my career now, but I just wanted to share how my techie side came to be. In high school, I got my hands on this super cheap tablet that kicked off my love affair with tech. I started watching loads of tech videos on YouTube, diving into hardware tech and binging on gadget unboxings and reviews, like any kid would.

There was this phase where I dreamt of being a YouTuber, inspired by tech influencers. But reality checkâ€”I'm camera-shy. Dreaming is one thing, doing is another. So, I shifted gears.

Post my 12th, I went down the rabbit hole of programming, websites, and everyday apps. YouTube tutorials introduced me to HTML and CSS, and I found myself enjoying it. "I can totally spend nights doing this," I thought. Tech became my new obsession. I decided not to overwhelm myself, starting with web development, and I created some basic websites that, looking back, were pretty laughable. But back then, they were my masterpieces.

Then, I entered into JavaScript scene, and I grappled with the mysterious `var` keyword. I didn't stop learning after that. YouTube, blogs, W3Schools, and MDN became my daily reads. Progress felt satisfying. I wasn't stressing about the future; I was just soaking in the joy of learning.

After a few months, armed with enough confidence, I applied for internships. To my surprise, I landed one after just two interviews at the ripe age of 18. The age question came up, but it never threw me off.

My understanding of the internet was pretty simpleâ€”stay curious, stay positive. Once in the industry, I kept soaking up knowledge. During my internship, I covered the basics of web development, learning from YouTube since the firm was using older tech. I solidified my JavaScript skills, dabbled in React, SaaS, UI libraries, and eventually transitioned to a full-time gig.

Later, I joined a startup, built a product from scratch, and shifted roles to become a full-stack engineer. In about 1.5 years, I went from intern to full-stack engineer. I'm not claiming to be the flashiest learner, but continuous learning is my jam.

This journey isn't just about me. If you've got passion and you're willing to put in the time and effort, you can pull off anything. Many have done it, and you can too. Forget stressing about the futureâ€”enjoy the present, keep learning, and growth will come your way.

### Was it that Easy?

I'll be honest â€” it wasn't a walk in the park. Being a non-CS person, I had to figure things out on my own, and my understanding of many concepts was a bit less than ideal. But hey, with practice, it's doable. I had to put in that extra effort to grasp things, to learn, and to break into the industry. It wasn't a cakewalk, but I was ready to go that extra mile, and I did. And you know what? I'm happy I did it. I'm exactly where I wanted to be.

### What I'm Doing Right Now?

Currently, I'm in the zone of building things and learning by breaking things. While I can't predict exactly where I'll be in the next 10 years, I'm confident it'll be something or someone that might inspire a few of you. For a deeper dive into my work, you can check out my [home](/) page and explore the projects I'm currently cooking up.

My focus is on crafting digital products and tools while delving into the intricacies of how everything in this tech world works. As mentioned in my bio, I'm gearing up to create something remarkable within the domains where my expertise lies, either through collaboration or on my own.

On the education front, I'm on the verge of completing my bachelor's degree in a non-computer subject. I had a bit of a hiccup in my school days, but despite that, I'm determined to keep working in the tech realm, specifically in software engineering. Excited about what the future holds!

### What's Next?

Now, I've shifted my focus to the captivating realms of **AI** and **LLMs**, and I'm in the process of crafting products in these spaces. Unlike some buzzword technologies, I firmly believe that **AI** and **LLMs** aren't just trends; they possess the power to reshape our world, influencing how we interact with machines and leveraging technology to enhance our lives.

Being part of this transformative wave is something I'm eager for. I'm immersing myself in learning and building around these technologies, and it's both fascinating and challenging. The more I delve into it, the clearer it becomes how rapidly this field is evolving and the immense potential it holds. I'm thoroughly enjoying the journey.

### Conclusion

So, I haven't embarked on a grand journey yetâ€”I'm still a bit of a newbie here. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if I'm ready for these kinds of suggestions and talks. However, I'm committed to documenting and cultivating the habit of writing, and this marks the first step.

I've shared my entry into the tech world, what I'm up to now, and what lies ahead for me. I hope you found this journey interesting. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach outâ€”I'm here to help. I'll strive to keep the blog posts coming in the future.
