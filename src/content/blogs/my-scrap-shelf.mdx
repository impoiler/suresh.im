ðŸ‘‹ Hope all are doing fantastic!

This is a short note on the few projects I've built over the last two years for fun and learning. This is the note that I can come back to later and check. It might be helpful for some of you as well.

### [Tini.fyi](https://tini.fyi) - Short links generator for free

Tini is doing well, although I don't promote it anywhere, Itâ€™s my first project during my learning journey, and Iâ€™ve learned a lot along the way.

Itâ€™s a simple tool that can be very useful for many people. Iâ€™ve seen people sharing tini links on Twitter and LinkedIn, which is awesome because it means real people are using and sharing the tool. yeah it's very fun project for me and i think i'll continue maintaining it.

So far, Tini has around 5,000 shortened links, 150 registered users, and about 500,000 redirects.

### [Vani.club](https://vani.club) - Team collaboration tool for YouTube creators

Vani is a very ambitious product/tool for me personally because I have put a lot of effort into it. This tool was requested by one of the creators and could have been very helpful for many others.

However, things didn't work out as planned and eventually I had to stop actively working on it due to a lack of motivation and time. Nevertheless, I have to give it credit for teaching me many things, not just from a technical perspective but also from a monetization standpoint.

ðŸ’¡ - Sell the MVP first, then take feedback, improve, and repeatâ€”rather than building what you think is right for users.

### [Section.fyi](https://section.fyi) - A link in bio tool

Section is a very simple tool that works exactly like linktr[dot]ee and similar tools. It allows you to create a page with multiple links that you can put into your social media bio.

It was a fun project and had some real users, but I didn't renew the domain because there are many better products out there specializing in the same work. So, people can/should use those instead.

### [@poiler/utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@poiler/utils) - React hooks and utility functions

![@poiler/utils](/blog/poiler-utils-og.png)

This is the tiny npm package for React developers to help them with a couple of utilities and custom hooks they need in day-to-day development.

It includes some very useful hooks such as useClipboard, useDebounce, useScrollPosition, useKeyPress, and many more. Overall, good learning from this as well that I apply in my day-to-day development tasks, and I use this package in all of my projects.

I built a couple more projects in my free time. However, the main point is that none of the efforts put into these projects went to waste. Literally, every learning experience I gained from using these tools is now applied daily, helping me to understand things better.

Also, i can check the GitHub repository and review the code that I used to write. It's embarrassing to myself, but it's also an indicator that I have come far from where I was. So, keep building things that you love. Who knows, any of your side projects may become your full-time work. And even if not, there is no problem in building them just for fun and learning.

Keep doing what you love to do. ðŸ’š
